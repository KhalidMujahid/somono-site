                <div class="w-embed">
                    <h3>1 WHO ARE WE AND WHAT DO WE OFFER?</h3>
                    <p>We are Encore Capital B.V. (<strong>Sonomo</strong>, also: <strong>we</strong>, <strong>us
                        </strong>and <strong>our</strong>).</p>
                    <p><strong>Users</strong> (also: <strong>you</strong>) can access our Platform via our
                        <strong>Website</strong>: https://www.sonomo.com.</p>
                    <p>We provide <strong>Rightsholders</strong> the opportunity to release their <strong>Track(s)
                        </strong>on Digital Streaming Stores via third party music distributors. In addition, we operate
                        a <strong>Platform </strong>via which Rightsholders can fractionalise a <strong>Claim</strong>
                        (revenue relating to a Track released via us) into <strong>Shares</strong> and configure the
                        initial distribution of Shares between <strong>Investors</strong>. A User that owns one or more
                        Share is considered an Investor. Both the Rightsholder as well as any Investor may exchange
                        Shares via the <strong>Marketplace</strong> of the Platform.</p>
                    <p>In these terms and conditions (<strong>Terms</strong>) we stipulate the provisions that apply to
                        your use of our Platform and our Website and related services (together the
                        <strong>Services</strong>). Please find more information about our Services on our Website.</p>
                    <p>These Terms apply to the relationship between Sonomo and the User and to any and all other use of
                        our Services. The use of any Service provided by Sonomo is conditioned upon User&rsquo;s
                        compliance and acceptance of these Terms. Sonomo may amend these Terms. The latest version of
                        the Terms always applies to the relationship between Sonomo and the User. In addition to these
                        Terms, Rightsholders and Sonomo shall enter into a separate distribution agreement. In case of
                        any conflict between these Terms and the distribution agreement, the terms of the distribution
                        agreement shall prevail.</p>
                    <h3>2 DEFINITIONS</h3>
                    <p>In these Terms, we apply the following definitions:</p>
                    <p>2.1 <strong>Account</strong>: the Account on the Platform created by User, which is limited for
                        use by User via the Login Credentials.</p>
                    <p>2.2 <strong>Claim</strong>: the total claim of a Rightsholder towards Sonomo pursuant to the
                        digital streaming revenue generated by the Track via our Services. Beware that a Claim is
                        possibly not 100% of the worldwide digital streaming revenue of a Track (e.g. in case
                        rightsholders have entered into third party distribution contracts).</p>
                    <p>2.3 <strong>Share</strong>: a pro rata entitlement to a Claim. The Rightsholder may fractionalise
                        the Claim. For example, in case a Claim is fractionalised into 1000 equal Shares, then the owner
                        of 500 Shares has a claim on the Rightsholder equal to 50% of the Claim. Shares only exist
                        within the Rightsholder-Investor relationship. Sonomo only enters into a contractual
                        relationship with Rightsholders, and is never involved in any contractual relationship with
                        Investors.</p>
                    <p>2.4 <strong>Share Terms</strong>: these are all specific terms and characteristics that apply to
                        a Share in the Rightsholder-Investor relationship. These may vary among Shares and the
                        applicable Share Terms are stipulated prior to your purchase of the Share. Information on the
                        Share Terms that apply to any Share that you purchased are shown in your Account. Share Terms in
                        any case include: the percentual entitlement in relation to the Claim, the specification of the
                        Track and the identity of the Rightsholder.</p>
                    <p>2.5 <strong>Investor</strong>: a User that is entitled to one or more Share(s).</p>
                    <p>2.6 <strong>Marketplace</strong>: this is the marketplace of the Platform on which Shares may be
                        exchanged.</p>
                    <p>2.7 <strong>Rightsholder</strong>: the person or legal entity who submits a Track via Sonomo and
                        who, in respect of such Track, either (a) owns all relevant (intellectual property) rights and
                        entitlements or (b) has been duly authorized by any and all other (intellectual property)
                        rightsholders of the Track to submit that Track, configure payment splits in regard of it and
                        use any other functionality offered by our Platform.</p>
                    <p>2.8 <strong>Sonomo</strong>: [Encore Capital B.V., a limited liability company (<em>besloten
                            vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid</em>), incorporated under the laws of the
                        Netherlands, having its corporate seat in Amsterdam (address: Grote Bickersstraat 74-78, 1013 KS
                        Amsterdam, The Netherlands), and registered in the trade register of the Dutch Chamber of
                        Commerce under number 81884621]. In these Terms, Sonomo is also referred to as <strong>we,
                            us</strong> and <strong>our</strong>.</p>
                    <p>2.9 <strong>Track</strong>: an individual songs or track released by Rightsholder via Sonomo's
                        Services.</p>
                    <p>2.10 <strong>User</strong>: every natural person or legal entity making use of the Platform of
                        Sonomo, including Rightsholders and Investors. You must be at least eighteen (18) years old
                        and/or otherwise have authorization and legal power to create an Account and make use of the
                        Platform.</p>
                    <p>Other definitions are outlined &lsquo;in-text&rsquo; in the below.</p>
                    <h3>3 ACCOUNT</h3>
                    <p>3.1 Amongst other things, Users are required to provide an e-mail address and choose a strong
                        password in order to create an <strong>Account</strong> and be able to use the Platform. The
                        e-mail address and chosen password, together, form the <strong>Login Credentials</strong>. For
                        use of the Marketplace the User is required to have provided the following:</p>
                    <p>3.2 After creating an Account, Sonomo will evaluate whether User meets all requirements and
                        whether User may access the Marketplace. Sonomo will inform User about this within a reasonable
                        term, usually within [7] days after creating the Account.</p>
                    <p>3.3 User is fully responsible for non-disclosure of its Login Credentials and the use of its
                        Account. User may not allow use of its Account by any third party nor others that do not have
                        the authority to represent User. User guarantees that any third party that uses its Account is
                        authorized to represent User. If the User suspects that its Account has been breached, the User
                        will report this immediately to support@sonomo.com.</p>
                    <p>3.4 User agrees to only provide correct and complete information when creating an Account on the
                        Platform. User is responsible for the accuracy of any and all data in its Account and Sonomo
                        cannot be held liable in that respect.</p>
                    <p>3.5 Where a User is a legal entity, the natural person that opens the Account on behalf of such
                        legal entity warrants that it has the legal capacity and power to:</p>
                    <p>3.5.1 act on behalf of and to represent the specific legal entity;</p>
                    <p>3.5.2 proceed with the registration of the User to the Platform and the creation of the Account;
                        and</p>
                    <p>3.5.3 accept the present Terms and all other policy and guidelines of the Platform.</p>
                    <p>3.6 The User may request to cancel/terminate the User Account by contacting Sonomo. Sonomo may
                        need to retain certain information as required by law or as necessary for its business purposes.
                        For more information about the processing of personal data, please see the Privacy Policy
                        https://www.sonomo.com/privacy-policy.</p>
                    <p>3.7 At its own discretion, Sonomo is entitled at all times to suspend, block or delete the
                        Account of any User, for example in the case of contravention of one or more of the applicable
                        terms, fraud, disruption of a proper functioning of the Platform or if the Account, in the
                        opinion of Sonomo, can be harmful for the reputation of Sonomo or third parties. This includes
                        any (attempt to) manipulate streaming numbers including but not limited to plays of musical
                        recordings by bots, hijacked accounts, or through other inauthentic listening methods. Sonomo
                        furthermore has the right to refuse or to block an Account if the Account is linked to (a bank
                        account number which is linked to) an Account or User that is already blocked. User is not
                        entitled to any compensation by Sonomo in connection with the suspension, blocking or deletion
                        of the Account by Sonomo and User hereby waives any right to any compensation of damages.</p>
                    <p>3.8 Every User may only create one (1) Account. If, for whatsoever reason, the Account is blocked
                        or deleted, User is no longer entitled to use the Services in any way (whether through that
                        Account, another Account, or without an Account).</p>
                    <p>3.9 User must, at all times, act in accordance with the guidelines and instructions of Sonomo
                        with regard to the installation and use of the Platform.</p>
                    <p>3.10 Sonomo is entitled, at all times, to no longer make available certain functionalities of the
                        Account on the Platform, not to grant an Account or to demand additional requirements for
                        granting an Account.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="w-embed">
                    <h3>4 USE OF THE PLATFORM</h3>
                    <p>4.1 The User must ensure that the Platform is used in conformity with the Terms/Sonomo's
                        instructions and for the purpose that Sonomo intended them for. User is not allowed to use the
                        Platform in any way that affects the integrity or continuity of Sonomo's systems and/or
                        Services.</p>
                    <p>4.2 It is User&rsquo;s responsibility to use the Platform in compliance with applicable law and
                        with any third party rights. More specifically (without limitation), User is not allowed to use
                        the Platform:</p>
                    <p>(a) in a way that infringes on a third party's intellectual property rights;</p>
                    <p>(b) in a way that violates a person's privacy; or</p>
                    <p>(c) to conduct any illegal activity or solicit the performance of any illegal activity or other
                        activity that infringes the rights of third parties.</p>
                    <h3>5 ROLE OF RIGHTSHOLDER, SONOMO AND INVESTOR</h3>
                    <p>Role of the Rightsholder</p>
                    <p>5.1 Through the <strong>Splits Dashboard</strong> a Rightsholder can configure, per separate
                        Track, the applicable "<strong>Royalty Split</strong>" by assigning Shares to Investors. Sonomo
                        can only pay out to parties (Rightsholders or Investors) that have a fully completed Sonomo
                        account.</p>
                    <p>5.2 Initially, the Rightsholder is both the creditor and the debtor in respect of a Share. Once
                        the Rightsholder configures the Royalty Split of a Track resulting in the assignment of Shares
                        to Investors, Investor(s) shall become creditor towards the Rightsholder in relation to these
                        specific Shares.</p>
                    <p>5.3 It is the sole responsibility of the Rightsholder to configure the Royalty Split in
                        accordance with applicable law and with all existing agreements that concern entitlement to
                        (part of the) digital streaming revenue of the Track. Our Royalty Split configuration
                        functionality is merely a tool for the Rightsholder to distribute the Digital Streaming Revenue
                        in accordance with existing agreements with entitled parties. Sonomo never takes part in the
                        contractual relationship between Rightsholder and Investor and can never be addressed as debtor
                        by Investors.</p>
                    <p>5.4 In relation to a Share, only the Investor (acting as creditor) can alter. The Rightsholder
                        will at all times be the debtor towards Investor in relation to the Shares of any Track
                        submitted.</p>
                    <p>Role of Sonomo</p>
                    <p>5.5 We offer the possibility of trading Shares through our Marketplace. Sonomo is never a
                        contractual party in the relationship regarding any Share between the Investor (as owner of a
                        Share) and the Rightsholder concerned.</p>
                    <p>5.6 We levy a transaction fee on the side of the buying Investor and of the selling Investor upon
                        each Purchase of a Share. This transaction fee is reflected in the price paid by the Investor,
                        and is visible prior to placing an order. You agree to the transaction fee scheme specified
                        within the website. Sonomo may, in its discretion, update the transaction fees at any time. Any
                        updated transaction fees will apply to any sales or other Purchases that occur following the
                        effective date of the updated fees. You authorize Sonomo to deduct from your account any
                        applicable fees that you owe under these Terms.</p>
                    <p>5.7 Until at least 5% of the Claim has been marketed via the Marketplace, Sonomo reserves the
                        right to set thresholds for minimum percentages and prices of Shares that are offered.</p>
                    <p>Role of the Investor</p>
                    <p>5.8 In relation to a Share, a User can become an Investor either by (i) being assigned as
                        creditor of such Share by the Rightsholder or (ii) successfully executing the Purchase of such
                        Share as a buyer.</p>
                    <h3>6 TRANSACTION OF SHARES</h3>
                    <p>Transaction mechanics</p>
                    <p>6.1 The owner of Shares of a specific Track, may offer one or more of such Shares for sale by
                        placing a sell-order. The buyer may place a buy-order for Shares regarding a specific Track.
                        More information on what types of sell- and buy-orders are available, please see our website.
                    </p>
                    <p>6.2 Any placed buy-order or sell-order is considered to be an instruction of User to Sonomo for
                        using our Services to conclude the specified Purchases (an "<strong>Order</strong>").</p>
                    <p>6.3 Upon sending an Order, your Account will be immediately updated to reflect the open Orders,
                        and your Orders will be included in Sonomo's order book regarding the Track to match other
                        users' Orders. If one of your Orders fully or partially matches another user's Order, Sonomo
                        will execute an exchange (a "<strong>Purchase</strong>"). Once the Purchase is executed, your
                        account will be updated to reflect that the order has been fully executed and closed, or the
                        Order has been partially executed. The Order will remain uncompleted until it is fully executed
                        or cancelled under clause 6.4 below. To conclude a Purchase, you authorize Sonomo to temporarily
                        control the funds&nbsp;available in your Account.</p>
                    <p>6.4 For Orders initiated through our Marketplace, you may only cancel them before they have been
                        matched with other Users' Orders. Once your Order has been matched with another user's Order of
                        which you receive a notification, you may not change, revoke or cancel Sonomo's authorization to
                        complete the Order and/or Purchase. For any partially matched Order, you may cancel the
                        unmatched part of the Order unless such portion has been matched. We reserve the right to reject
                        any cancellation request related to the Order you have submitted. If your account does not have
                        sufficient funds to execute an Order, we may cancel the entire Order, or execute part of the
                        Order with the funds available in your account (in each case, any Purchase related fees payable
                        to Sonomo are deducted as stated in paragraph (c) below).</p>
                    <p>Legal qualification of the exchange of a Share</p>
                    <p>6.5 The Purchase of a Share is legally qualified as a contract takeover
                        (<em>contractsoverneming</em>) which is fulfilled when the sales price set by the owner of the
                        Share is paid by the buyer.</p>
                    <p>6.6 The 'contract' which is taken over consists of the applicable Share Terms. In addition to the
                        Share Terms, these Terms always apply to the relationship between the owner of a Share and the
                        relevant Rightsholder.</p>
                    <p>6.7 As a result of a successful contract takeover, the buyer of the Share will fully replace the
                        seller as the Rightsholder&rsquo;s counterparty. All rights against and obligations towards the
                        Rightsholder will be transferred from such seller to the buyer.</p>
                    <p>6.8 Each time prior to the placement of an Order in accordance with these Terms you will be
                        requested to confirm such placement within our Platform. By submitting this confirmation, you
                        agree in advance that:</p>
                    <p>6.8.1 Purchases may be executed in accordance with these Terms;</p>
                    <p>6.8.2 as a seller, upon each executed Purchase pursuant to the Order, all rights against and
                        obligations towards the relevant Rightsholder are transferred from the seller to the buyer in
                        respect of the Share that is exchanged;</p>
                    <p>6.8.3 as a buyer, upon each executed Purchase pursuant to the Order, you fully replace the
                        relevant seller as the Rightsholder's counterparty and you are bound by all rights against and
                        obligations towards the Rightsholder in respect of the Share that is exchanged;</p>
                    <p>6.8.4 for each executed Purchase, the respective contract takeover will be (i) automatically
                        recorded in accordance with the above in an individual "<strong>Share Certificate</strong>" with
                        your aforementioned submitted confirmation serving as a signature (within the meaning of Section
                        156 Dutch Code of Civil Procedure) of any and all Share Certificates resulting from your Order;
                        and (ii) notified to the relevant Rightsholder on your behalf.</p>
                    <p>6.8.5 you hereby confirm to us that once an individual Share changes hands under an Order,
                        Rightsholder instructs Sonomo to pay to the buyer (new owner) all parts of the Claim to which
                        the Share relates &ndash; also see clause 9 &ndash; without applying pro rata schemes according
                        to ownership of Shares during a certain term.</p>
                    <h3>7 DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h3>
                    <p>7.1 If Users have a dispute, e.g. Investors and Rightsholders, Users must resolve these disputes
                        themselves, in good faith consultations. If Users cannot jointly resolve the matter, then Sonomo
                        may, entirely without obligation, act as an intermediary. Users indemnify Sonomo from and
                        against claims for compensation of damages by virtue of such decision.</p>
                    <p>7.2 Investors (buyers and sellers) and Rightsholders are obliged to execute the Share Terms in
                        accordance with applicable legislation and regulations and these Terms.</p>
                    <h3>8 PAYMENTS BY BUYERS WHEN ACQUIRING SHARES</h3>
                    <p>8.1 Sonomo sets up the Platform as such that User can make the payment related to a Purchase (the
                        <strong>Payment</strong>).</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>9 PAY-OUT OF DIGITAL STREAMING REVENUE</h3>
                    <p>9.1 For each Track, the date on which payment of the [Claim] is due to be processed is provided
                        on the [<em>name of webpage that includes this information</em>] (the "<strong>Payment
                            Date</strong>").</p>
                    <p>9.2 Pursuant to the Rightsholder's instruction, the Claim is paid out by Sonomo in accordance
                        with the property distribution of Shares at time of the Payment Date.</p>
                    <p>9.3 If for any reason the pay-out of a Claim is not fulfilled on the Payment Date, the
                        <em>page</em> will be immediately updated to reflect such late payment.</p>
                    <p>9.4 Payment restrictions might prevent us from paying revenue to entities established or persons
                        in certain countries. On our website (https://www.sonomo.com/frequently-asked-questions-faqs) we
                        will list the countries to which we cannot process payments. If you are a formal resident of or
                        your entity is established in such a country, please do not make use of our Services.</p>

                    <p>10.1 Sonomo will use reasonable efforts to make the Platform available at all times. Sonomo does
                        not accept any responsibility whatsoever for unavailability of the Platform, or any difficulty
                        or inability to download or access content, or any other communication system failure which may

                    <p>10.2 Sonomo is not responsible for any support or maintenance regarding the Platform. Sonomo may

                    <p>10.3 To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Sonomo hereby disclaims all implied
                        warranties regarding the availability of the Platform. The Platform is provided "as is" and "as
                        available" without warranty of any kind.</p>
                    <p>10.4 Sonomo has no control over the (mis)conduct of, or any (mis)information provided by a

                        by applicable law. We do not guarantee that a Share will obtain you a certain amount of revenue
                        or any revenue at all. We do not endorse any Share or Claim, and we make no guarantee, express
                        or implied, that any information provided through the Platform is accurate. User must make the

                    <h3>11 LIABILITY</h3>
                    <p>11.1 User is fully responsible and liable for use of the Platform.</p>
                    <p>11.2 User will fully indemnify Sonomo for any damages or costs of whatsoever nature arising from
                        the non-fulfilment of one or more obligations under these Terms.</p>
                    <p>11.3 In its activities under these Terms, User is obliged to fully comply with all the applicable
                        legislation and regulations and indemnifies Sonomo for any damages or costs of whatsoever nature

                    <p>11.4 User is fully responsible in all respects for paying any applicable taxes according to the
                        applicable tax laws of their country.</p>

                        connection, internal network, and all other systems that are relevant or necessary for
                        undisturbed use of the Platform.</p>
                    <p>11.6 Unless there is wilful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of Sonomo, Sonomo is not
                        liable in any way for User's (direct or indirect) damages or costs of whatsoever nature in
                        connection with use of the Platform, the Account or the information shared on the Platform, such
                        as, but not limited to, damages and costs due to the lack of a proper functioning of the
                        Platform, technical faults and unlawful information on the Platform. Sonomo cannot be and is not
                        responsible for compliance of User&rsquo;s obligations.</p>
                    <p>11.7 Nothing in these Terms shall exclude or limit Sonomo&rsquo;s liability when it cannot be
                        excluded or limited under applicable law, such as in the case of intent or gross fault by
                        Sonomo. If Sonomo (nevertheless) is liable towards User, this will be limited to 10% of the
                        payments made to/due to Sonomo by User during the calendar year in which the liability causing
                        event took place.</p>
                    <h3>12 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h3>
                    <p>12.1 Sonomo is the exclusive owner of all current and future, worldwide, intellectual property
                        rights, such as, but not limited to patents, patent applications, trademarks, trademark
                        applications, service marks, trade names, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses, domain names,
                        know-how, URL&rsquo;s and web addresses, ownership rights and processes, databases, data
                        collections and any rights therein in relation to the Services and the Platform (and the
                        underlying source and object code and the accompanying technical documentation) (the
                        <strong>Intellectual Property Rights</strong>).</p>
                    <p>12.2 User obtains a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable and revocable license
                        intended for fair use of the Services (and the Platform) in accordance with these Terms. If User
                        no longer complies with its obligations, Sonomo can withdraw this licence with no notice of
                        default being required.</p>
                    <p>12.3 For clarity sake: a Purchase does not constitute any transfer of ownership with regard to
                        the musical recording(s) it relates to, nor does the license referred to in clause 12.2 concern
                        any use of (intellectual property vested in) such musical recordings.</p>
                    <h3>13 PRIVACY</h3>

                    <h3>15 MISCELLANEOUS</h3>
                    <p>15.1 No omission or delay on the part Sonomo in exercising any right, power or remedy under these
                        Terms, shall prejudice or impair such right, power or remedy or be construed as a waiver
                        thereof. Any single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy shall not preclude any
                        other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.</p>
                    <p>15.2 Sonomo reserves the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time if Sonomo finds this
                        reasonably necessary and useful. When we change these Terms in a significant way, we will notify
                        our User via mail.</p>
                    <p>15.3 If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will
                        be limited or eliminated to the maximum extent necessary so that the rest of these Terms will
                        remain in full force and effect and stay enforceable. Any such unenforceable or invalid
                        provision shall be replaced or be deemed to be replaced by a provision that is considered to be
                        valid and enforceable, and which interpretation shall be as close as possible to the intent of
                        the invalid provision.</p>
                    <p>15.4 User cannot transfer its rights and obligations under these Terms to third parties. Sonomo
                        can assign and/or transfer all rights and obligations under these Terms to a third party,
                        without consent from User being required.</p>
                    <p>15.5 All provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive
                        termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers,
                        indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>
                    <h3>16 APPLICABLE LAW AND COMPETENT COURT</h3>

                        Netherlands.</p>
