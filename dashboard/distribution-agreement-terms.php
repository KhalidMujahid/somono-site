            <div class="w-richtext">
                <p>Thank you for choosing Sonomo (&quot;<strong>Sonomo</strong>&quot;, <strong>“Encore Capital
                        B.V.”</strong>, also: &quot;<strong>we</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>us</strong>&quot; and
                    &quot;<strong>our</strong>&quot;) to distribute your music! We offer any person or legal entity that
                    wants to make use of our distribution services (&quot;<strong>you</strong>&quot;, also:
                    &quot;<strong>your</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>Rightsholder</strong>&quot;) the opportunity to
                    release music on Digital Streaming Stores. In these &quot;<strong>Terms</strong>&quot; we stipulate
                    the provisions that apply to your use of our platform, application, website and (distribution)
                    services (together the &quot;<strong>Services</strong>&quot;).</p>
                <p>Other terms that apply to your use of the Services are: our privacy policy
                    (https://www.sonomo.com/privacy-policy), the Terms and Conditions
                    (https://www.sonomo.com/terms-and-conditions) and the Uploading Guidelines. You acknowledge that you
                    have read, understood and accepted this Distribution Agreement and agree to be bound by them. All
                    representations and warranties provided by you under this Distribution Agreement are deemed to be
                    provided on a case-by-case basis as you upload Tracks and/or make use of our Services. If you don’t
                    agree with (or cannot comply with) this Distribution Agreement at any time, then immediately refrain
                    from accessing or using our Services.</p>
                <h3><br /></h3>
                <h3>1 Definitions</h3>
                <p>1.1 <strong>Claim</strong>: the total claim of a Rightsholder towards Sonomo pursuant to the digital
                    streaming revenue generated by the Track via our Services. Beware that a Claim is possibly not 100%
                    of the worldwide digital streaming revenue of a Track (e.g. in case rightsholders have entered into
                    third party distribution contracts).</p>
                <p>1.2 <strong>Share</strong>: a pro rata entitlement to a Claim. The Rightsholder may fractionalise the
                    Claim. For example, in case a Claim is fractionalised into 1000 equal Shares, then the owner of 500
                    Shares has a claim on the Rightsholder equal to 50% of the Claim. Shares only exist within the
                    Rightsholder-Investor relationship. Sonomo only enters into a contractual relationship with
                    Rightsholders, and is never involved in any contractual relationship with Investors.</p>
                <h3><br /></h3>
                <h3>2 Distribution Services</h3>
                <p>2.1 Sonomo facilitates distribution of music through various &quot;<strong>Digital Streaming
                        Stores</strong>&quot; (such as Spotify, Apple Music, Google Play Music, Amazon Music, TIDAL,
                    Deezer, TikTok and a lot more)</p>
                <p>2.2 A recording that you intend to make available through digital streaming (a
                    &quot;<strong>Recording</strong>&quot;) can be uploaded via our online dashboard
                    (https://app.sonomo.com or https://distro.sonomo.com/, depending on your account type). We offer a
                    simple, user-friendly experience without unnecessary hassle. The Recording, together with any
                    &quot;<strong>Meta-data</strong>&quot; (e.g. track names, artist names, catalogue number, and so on)
                    and/or &quot;<strong>Content</strong>&quot; (such as cover art and artist profile) that you upload
                    is referred to hereinafter as the &quot;<strong>Track</strong>&quot;.</p>
                <p>2.3 Part of our service is that you can configure how the revenue generated by your Track under this
                    Agreement should be distributed. For example, you can configure how much the artist(s) should
                    receive, the label and any other persons who are entitled to a percentage of the revenue based on
                    your existing contractual agreements.</p>
                <p>2.4 You will receive 100% of what we receive from the Digital Streaming Stores and/or third party
                    distributors (&quot;<strong>Digital Streaming Revenue</strong>&quot;, as further defined in clause
                    4). How you subsequently distribute this revenue, remains your responsibility.</p>
                <p>2.5 Subject to your compliance with these Terms, you may access and use Sonomo during the
                    Subscription Term (as defined in clause 8).</p>
                <h3><br /></h3>
                <h3>3 The License</h3>
                <p>3.1 We do not require you to transfer ownership of (intellectual property vested in the) Track to us.
                </p>
                <p>3.2 By accepting this Distribution Agreement and/or using our Services, you grant us and our
                    sub-licensees to the fullest extent permitted under statutory law a non-exclusive, revocable,
                    royalty-free, fully sub-licensable, transferable, worldwide &quot;<strong>License</strong>&quot;:
                </p>
                <p>3.2.1 to distribute, publicly perform, exhibit, broadcast, transmit, digitally make available the
                    Track on (without limitation) the Sonomo website, application and/or platform, all Digital Streaming
                    Stores and any other similar digital media for sale by downloading, interactive and non-interactive
                    streaming, cloud services and streaming-on-demand, now known or future developed similar means of
                    making use of the Track, in any form and/or digital format;</p>
                <p>3.2.2 to sell, market, advertise, promote the Track, in the broadest sense, by all means and media,
                    and to perform all actions that may be necessary or conducive to this end;</p>
                <p>3.2.3 to collect from Digital Streaming Stores (and or their sublicensees or licensors) the revenues
                    generated in relation to exploitation of your Track by Digital Streaming Stores;</p>
                <p>and you agree that we may subcontract some or all of the operations permitted under the above License
                    to any third party (&quot;<strong>Third Party Service Provider</strong>&quot;).</p>
                <p>3.3 However, there may be various parties involved in the creation of such Track and you might not be
                    the sole rightsholder. Therefore, you represent and warrant that you (i) are the sole rightsholder
                    or (ii) have obtained all necessary rights, licenses, waivers, clearances and permissions, including
                    without limitation all music publishing rights and licenses needed for the grant of the License with
                    respect to any Track you upload, in order to enable us to fully exploit the Track free of any
                    claims, liens, encumbrances or other restrictions.</p>
                <p>3.4 For each and every Track that utilizes, gets fractionalized, and/or exchanged through our
                    Marketplace (see section Marketplace of this agreement and relevant terms of conditions), you grant
                    us to the fullest extent permitted under statutory law an <strong>exclusive</strong>, irrevocable,
                    royalty-free, fully sub-licensable, transferable, worldwide &quot;License&quot; to distribute the
                    Track in perpetuity and agree not to grant any rights to any third party that would conflict with
                    the exclusivity of this License.</p>
                <p>‍</p>
                <h3><br /></h3>
                <h3>4 Paying out Digital Streaming Revenue</h3>
                <p>4.1 We pay out 100% of the revenue earned from the Digital Streaming Stores through which your Track
                    is distributed via Sonomo, excluding any fees from third-party aggregators and/or distributors as

                    amounts to cover costs associated with handling money and payments on your behalf.</p>
                <p>4.2 Sonomo shall receive all revenue in Euros and make any and all payments to you in Euros. You
                    shall bear all risk and costs in respect of any conversion of currencies in respect of transactions
                    effected in relation to or execution of this Distribution Agreement.</p>
                <p>4.3 Any and all payments are processed through our payment processing partners (Stripe, Weavr,
                    Paypal) or partner banks.</p>
                <p>4.4 Payment restrictions might prevent us from paying revenue to entities established in certain
                    countries. On our website (https://www.sonomo.com/frequently-asked-questions-faqs) we will list the
                    countries to which we cannot process payments. If your entity is established in such a country,
                    please do not make use of our Services.</p>
                <p>4.5 You acknowledge that for the payment of royalties we are depending on the accuracy of reports on
                    royalties provided by Digital Streaming Stores and/or other third parties engaged by us. We do not
                    assume any liability with respect to such reports. We reserve the right to at all times
                    retroactively correct payments pursuant to wrong or inaccurate reporting.</p>
                <p>4.6 We may at any time and in our sole discretion remove all or part of your Track, deny you access
                    to the Services without notice and withhold all Digital Streaming Revenue in relation to the
                    Recording(s) that infringe or are alleged to infringe any intellectual property right(s) or violate
                    the rights of third parties.</p>

                    &quot;<strong>Royalty Split</strong>&quot;. We can only pay out to parties that have a Sonomo
                    account set up. Our Royalty Split configuration functionality is merely a tool for you to distribute
                    the Digital Streaming Revenue in accordance with your existing agreements with entitled parties.</p>
                <p>5.2 You represent and warrant that the configuration of the Royalty Split is at all times accurate,
                    in accordance with all agreements existing between any and all rightsholders of the Track you upload
                    and that there are no expected or known disputes regarding entitlement to any revenue (to be)
                    generated by the Track.</p>
                <p>5.3 You are responsible in all respects for paying any other rightsholders and any applicable taxes
                    according to the applicable tax laws of your country.</p>

                <p>6.1 You explicitly acknowledge and agree to have read and understood the terms and conditions.</p>
                <p>6.2 The Claim may be fractionalised and exchanged through the Marketplace only in accordance with the
                    terms and conditions.</p>
                <p>6.3 You hereby explicitly, in advance, acknowledge, agree and consent to all future contract
                    takeovers effectuated in accordance with the terms and conditions, in relation to any purchase of a

                    visible in your Account in the aforementioned manner, such has been received by you and you waive
                    any right to claim otherwise.</p>
                <p>6.5 Each and every Track and its Shares submitted and/or offered by you on the Marketplace should be
                    accompanied by meta-data and/or content sufficient to describe the (musical recordings underlying a)
                    Claim as accurate as possible (e.g. track name(s), artist names, record label, catalogue number as
                    well as cover art and artist profile).</p>
                <p>6.6 For each and every Track that utilizes the Marketplace, you hereby grant us to the fullest extent
                    permitted under statutory law an <strong>exclusive</strong>, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully
                    sub-licensable, transferable, perpetual, worldwide &quot;License&quot; to distribute Track(s) and
                    agree not to grant any rights to any third party that would conflict with the exclusivity of this
                    License.</p>

                    Plan’s designated allotment may result in (additional) fees, and such fees will be included in a
                    true-up invoice or charged automatically via the payment method associated with your Sonomo Account
                    (&quot;Payment Method&quot;).</p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p>8.2 Billing and Payment: For any paid Subscription Plan, you agree to make payments, and we may
                    automatically charge your Payment Method, as described below, for so long as your Sonomo Account
                    remains active. Subscription Plans may be offered for a set subscription period (each such period, a
                    &quot;Subscription Term&quot;). If you elect to sign up for a paid Subscription Plan, you agree to
                    the pricing and payment terms specified at checkout, at
                    https://www.sonomo.com/distribution-and-aggregation-for-labels-plans, or as otherwise posted or
                    communicated to you, as we may update them from time to time. You must provide Sonomo with a
                    current, valid, accepted Payment Method. When you initiate a purchase transaction, you authorize us
                    to provide your payment information to third parties so we can complete your transaction and to
                    charge your Payment Method, in Euros, for the type of transaction you have selected (plus any
                    applicable taxes and other charges) and any applicable recurring charges as described below. You
                    will pay applicable taxes, if any, relating to any such transaction and are also responsible for any
                    payment-related fees such as wire transfer fees, credit card processing fees, and foreign
                    transaction fees. We currently use Stripe as our third party service provider for payment services,
                    and by using Sonomo you agree to be bound by Stripe’s Services Agreement, currently available at
                    https://stripe.com/en-nl/legal. If your payment is not successfully settled for any reason, you
                    remain responsible for any amounts not remitted to us. All payments for transactions are
                    non-refundable and non-transferable except as expressly provided in these Terms.</p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p>8.3 Renewals: Your subscription continues until canceled by you or we terminate your access to or use
                    of Sonomo in accordance with these Terms. Unless and until canceled by you, all Subscription Plans
                    will automatically renew for renewal terms equal in length to the original Subscription Term. If you
                    do not want a Subscription Plan to renew, you must cancel it before the end of the Subscription Term
                    via the account settings page on your Sonomo Account). If you purchase a Subscription Plan, we (or
                    our third-party payment processor) will automatically charge you each year or month, as applicable,
                    on the anniversary of the commencement of your subscription, using the payment information you have
                    provided, until you cancel your subscription. By agreeing to these Terms and electing to purchase a
                    Subscription Plan, you acknowledge that your Subscription Plan has recurring payment features and
                    you accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation of your
                    subscription by you or us.</p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p>8.4 Cancellations and Terminations: If we cancel or terminate your Subscription Plan, except in the
                    event of your breach or failure to pay fees when due, we will grant you a prorated refund for the
                    remaining unused portion of your Subscription Term. If you cancel or terminate your Subscription
                    Plan, your right to use Sonomo will continue until the end of your then-current Subscription Term
                    and then terminate without further charges. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you live in the
                    European Union or Turkey and cancel your Subscription Plan within fourteen (14) days of purchase,
                    you will be eligible for a refund of any payments made for the canceled Subscription Term, and, if
                    you request such a refund, your right to use Sonomo will terminate immediately upon cancellation of
                    your subscription. Subject to the preceding sentence, if you cancel or terminate your Subscription
                    Plan, unless required by law, YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY PORTION OF ANY FEES PAID FOR THE
                    THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION TERM AT THE TIME OF CANCELLATION.</p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p>8.5 Late Payments: Any late payments shall be subject to a service charge equal to 1.5% per month of
                    the amount due or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less (plus the costs of
                    collection).</p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p>8.6 Credits: Any credits that may accrue to your Sonomo Account (for example, as a result of a
                    promotion or referral program, or a Subscription Plan downgrade) will expire one year following
                    their accrual, or upon expiration or termination of your Sonomo Account, whichever is earlier.
                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, any credits accrued to an account on a free Subscription Plan will
                    expire if the account’s Subscription Plan is not upgraded to a paid Subscription Plan within ninety
                    (90) days of accrual, unless otherwise specified. Credits have no currency or exchange value, and
                    are not transferable or refundable.</p>
                <p><br /></p>
